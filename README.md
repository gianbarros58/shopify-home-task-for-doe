# Shopify DOE Test Page

I started from the latest **Dawn theme** to build the test page for DOE.  
The work focuses on **layout implementation** based on the provided design.

---

## What I Built
- Customized the **Homepage**.
- Created **8 sections** according to the design.
- Installed and configured **Tailwind CSS v4** locally.
- Built and **minified Tailwind CSS** (`theme.css`) before pushing.

---

## Notes
- This project is **layout-focused only**.  
- I intentionally did not implement any advanced **functionality** or dynamic features.  
- The goal was to match the **design and responsive layout** as closely as possible.

---

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Import the theme into your Shopify store:
   ```bash
   shopify theme push
